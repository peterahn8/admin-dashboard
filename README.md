Admin Dasboard is an HTML/CSS mock-up project. The objective is to demonstrate CSS grid as opposed to CSS flexbox.

The result is a highly modular skeleton that can be rearranged and resized in two-dimensions (more easily than with flexbox).

CSS grid is not a be-all-end-all replacement for flexbox. Flexbox is arguably better at maintaining growth/shrinkage along a single axis. Luckily, you can use grid and flexbox simultaneously.

I was also able to test the Tailwind framework in a separate branch. Frameworks make front-end development modular too. If a project's requirements allow for the use of a framework, maybe it's a good idea to start with one. It must save tons of time.
